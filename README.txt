Hello, howdy, hiya!

My name is Hannah Edwards and I have aaccidentially found myself going down the path of a web dev. 

This project is another practice website with the goal of replacing the current website used by the improv group Shoot From the Hip. 
I enjoy their content and when I visited their website on mobile it... inspired me to try to do better.

I am open to suggestions.
